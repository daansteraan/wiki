Well this was fun.... I am pretty happy with the end result... Notable differences is that most other projects make the article itself a link wheras I added a button once the article pops up. Many folks also made more than one article appear. I have no problem with this but just liked the idea of one thing on the page since I was aiming for simplicity.  My concerns: I want to learn more about writing unit tests for these functions. Also this is very different to how I would normally structure code in Python. would like to know how I can more clearly define function (or even class-esqe types) in js and then test and re-use these later on the code.
